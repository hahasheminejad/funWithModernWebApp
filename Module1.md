# Modern Web App - Accelerated Hands on Workshop

What are we doing: 

In this tutorial we build the first set of components of the modern web app.  To accelerate our application launching we are going to put a lot of material from https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-modern-application-workshop/tree/python into cloudformation.  

# As you arrive: 

1. Get on the wireless network. 
2. Get a good text editor.  Your options are Notepad++, Visual Studio Code  - basically anything you know how to use that can compare two text files side by side.   
3. Find Adrian and ask him to send you the $50 voucher code

# Step one - get all the prerequisites

1. Log in to your AWS Account

2. Choose the region Ohio - Us-east-2.  THIS IS IMPORTANT. The entire demo is only in this region.  Do not use any other regions. 

3. Go to Services, EC2, click "Key Pairs", Create a key pair called mysfits.  This is case sensitive.  If you created Mysfits, MYSFITS - you will not deploy and things will start failing.  If you have misspelt it - just create a new one. 

4. Once you have your voucher - apply it as per instructions in the email.
